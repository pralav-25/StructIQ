StructIQ is an AI-driven platform designed for predictive infrastructure monitoring. By converting complex concrete and structural data into actionable maintenance timelines, StructIQ helps cities and organizations transition from reactive repairs to proactive, predictive prevention.
System v1.0.4 provides a structural intelligence interface that monitors civil infrastructure in real-time. The platform uses multi-sensor fusion to track critical parameters like load, vibration, and temperature to provide a comprehensive health score for assets like bridges and buildings.
Live Asset Diagnostics: Real-time monitoring of assets (e.g., Asset ID-402) with live feeds for Load, Vibration (g), and Temperature (°C).
Deep Analysis: Automated health scoring (0-100) based on structural integrity, load capacity, and material degradation.
AI-Driven Insights: Automated detection of issues like stress fractures using sensor data fusion.
Citizen Reporting Portal: A specialized mobile-optimized interface for the public to report infrastructure issues, featuring automated scanning and immediate AI results.
CAD-Inspired UI: A high-performance, dark-themed interface featuring parallax "blueprint" visualizations of urban environments.
